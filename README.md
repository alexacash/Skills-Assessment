<<<<<<< HEAD
Tools - HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery

Methods - When creating the layout, I opted to make use of columns and sections
		  to organize the single page site. 

		- Given that there was not a lot of reusable CSS code, I tried to section 
		  off the style sheets as much as possible to keep from overwhleming 
		  with 200+ lines of CSS. I imported them in my HTML head individually. 

		- I tried to use as many cross-compadible unites of measurements as possible, 
		  such as rem, % and em, rather than pixel measurements as that can be choppy. 

		- when positioninng items and making a clear level of display so not to have 
		  unnattrictive overlay, I used z-index often for specific these tasks.
